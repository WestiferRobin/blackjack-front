    - Include the "General Notes" options
    - Have high scores

    - I need it to login in.....
- Ending Functionality to Apply

    - Add some sounds if possible VERY SIMILAR TO VIDEO BLACKJACK
        - Replicate with Garageband or FL studio and apply the sounds because sounds are not free.
    - Group Game                              
        - Solo View but with multiple players ( 2 - 7 )
        - Able to choose a "seat"
    
## General Notes
- WHEN I get to the backend. Here are some notes that I was doodling out side of dev time.
    - It's a javascript projects thus I need express.js
    - Inputs should be dealer and player ammount ONLY (1v1) and some how include face cards to determine splits or whatever 
    - Have the output be some binary rep of the states (Stand, Hit, Spilt, Double, or Surrender). 
    - PROBLEM is designing each node to spit out relations to get the output aka the desired state.
    - ALSO NOTE: you need to have some indicator at the top of the screen of when the needed info is completed for the NN to run simulations.
        - AKA A SHIT TON OF TESTING!!!!!! and update the UI once decided on a value.

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
    - Able to buy more "Fake Money" or look at charging people money some how for "Money"
