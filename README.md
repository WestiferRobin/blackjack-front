- Solo View
    - See about chaning the card layout to using svg file assets from this location
        - https://github.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/tree/master/svg-cards
    - Should have player cards and with working buttons as well as displaying cards with betting ammount.
        - Hit, Stand, Double, Split should work flawlessly
    - Should have dealer cards showed and card ammount
    - Sync logic of basic game of blackjack from player and dealer.
    - Create as a mode with the Splsh screen (App.js)
- App.js
    - Move everything from App to be in different views
    - Blackjack title will need to be center and on top.
    - Modes should be on the side. (Look at modes in General Notes)
    - Should have a dummy login and page creation.
- Group Game
    - Solo View but with multiple players
- Traning 
    - Include the "General Notes" options
    - Have high scores 
    - Be sure Quiz game is the gate keeper for getting into the casino or not
- Options
    - Basic shit for options? Just have it created and revist again after simulation.
- Simulation
    - CREATE A FUCKING BASIC NN.
    - Have different options to generate a graph and rates
    - Bonus points if you can animate it
    
## General Notes
- Should have the following modes/views
    - Trainer
        - Betting 
        - Basic Strategy
        - Counting
        - Quiz Game
    - Solo Game
        - Don't know if there should be
    - Group Game (2-4 People)
        - Unsure if to include other local players but this will be in a casino settings
    - NN stats (Simulaton)
        - Need to do more digging on that....
        - Should at least write a wireframe on that
    - Options
        - Don't know what it would be used for but needed. 
- Since this will be user based there needs a loggin on the side

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- See if you can find poker noises and apply them some how.
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
