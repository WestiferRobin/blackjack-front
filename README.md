        - Basic Strategy
        - Counting
        - Quiz Game
    - Solo Game
        - Don't know if there should be
    - Group Game (2-4 People)
        - Unsure if to include other local players but this will be in a casino settings
    - NN stats (Simulaton)
        - Need to do more digging on that....
        - Should at least write a wireframe on that
    - Options
        - Don't know what it would be used for but needed. 
- Since this will be user based there needs a loggin on the side

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- See if you can find poker noises and apply them some how.
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
