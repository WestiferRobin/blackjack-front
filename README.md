# BLACK JACK FRONT END

## THE TODO(S)
- Solo View
    - Should have dealer and players cards showed and card ammount
        - Change the raw ints into an enum or a constants file
        - Fix the reset functionality
    - Player cards and with working buttons as well as displaying cards with betting ammount.
        - Hit, Stand, Double, Split should work flawlessly
            - Look at SoloEngine.js for notes under 
    - Sync logic of basic game of blackjack from player and dealer.
    - Able to have a betting system.
        - Use units and then dollar ammounts
- Test Scripts
    - Consider on having test scripts for the front end. I have no idea on how but I should consier it.
- Traning 
    - Include a selection of modes to choose
        - Counting, basic strategy, and quiz
- Options
    - Basic shit for options? Just have it created and revist again after simulation.
        - Hard reset to backend
        - able to select backdrop
        - able to select color scheme
        - Able to choose Money unit and bankroll 
    - Able to hold same game across mode header.
- Simulation
    - CREATE A FUCKING BASIC NN.
    - Have different options to generate a graph and rates
    - Bonus points if you can animate it
- Splash Screen
    - I need it to login in.....
- Ending Functionality to Apply
    - POLISH ALL OF THE UI IF NOT DONE ALREADY!!!!!!!!!
    - Look up on using ads on the website to generate revenue
    - Add some sounds if possible VERY SIMILAR TO VIDEO BLACKJACK
        - Replicate with Garageband or FL studio and apply the sounds because sounds are not free.
    
## General Notes
- WHEN I get to the backend. Here are some notes that I was doodling out side of dev time.
    - It's a javascript projects thus I need express.js
    - Inputs should be dealer and player ammount ONLY (1v1) and some how include face cards to determine splits or whatever 
    - Have the output be some binary rep of the states (Stand, Hit, Spilt, Double, or Surrender). 
    - PROBLEM is designing each node to spit out relations to get the output aka the desired state.
    - ALSO NOTE: you need to have some indicator at the top of the screen of when the needed info is completed for the NN to run simulations.
        - AKA A SHIT TON OF TESTING!!!!!! and update the UI once decided on a value.

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
    - Able to buy more "Fake Money" or look at charging people money some how for "Money"
