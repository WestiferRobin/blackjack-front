# BLACK JACK FRONT END

## Development TODOS
- App.js
    - Move everything from App to be in different views
    - Blackjack title will need to be center and on top.
    - Modes should be on the side.
    - Should have a dummy login and page creation.
- 1v1 View
    - See about chaning the card layout to using svg file assets from this location
        - https://github.com/hayeah/playing-cards-assets/tree/master/svg-cards
    - Should have dealer cards with ammount
    - Should have player cards and with working buttons
        - Hit, Stand, Double, Split should work flawlessly

## General Notes
- Should have the following modes/views
    - Card counting 
    - Basic strategy 
    - 1v1 Game 
        - Don't know if there should be 
    - NN stats
        - Need to do more digging on that....
        - Should at least write a wireframe on that
- Since this will be user based there needs a loggin on the side

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- See if you can find poker noises and apply them some how.
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
