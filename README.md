# BLACK JACK FRONT END

## THE TODO(S)
- Solo View
    - Fix warnings before starting dev for SoloView
    - Add some sounds if possible VERY SIMILAR TO VIDEO BLACKJACK
        - Replicate with Garageband or FL studio and apply the sounds because sounds are not free.
    - Should have dealer and players cards showed and card ammount
    - Player cards and with working buttons as well as displaying cards with betting ammount.
        - Hit, Stand, Double, Split should work flawlessly
    - Sync logic of basic game of blackjack from player and dealer.
    - Able to have a betting system.
        - Use units and then dollar ammounts
- Test Scripts
    - Consider on having test scripts for the front end. I have no idea on how but I should consier it.
- Group Game                              
    - Solo View but with multiple players ( 2 - 7 )
    - Able to choose a "seat"
- Traning 
    - Include the "General Notes" options
    - Have high scores 
    - Be sure Quiz game is the gate keeper for getting into the casino or not
- Options
    - Basic shit for options? Just have it created and revist again after simulation.
        - Hard reset to backend
        - able to select backdrop
        - able to select color scheme
        - Able to choose Money unit and bankroll
    - Able to hold same game across mode header.
- Simulation
    - CREATE A FUCKING BASIC NN.
    - Have different options to generate a graph and rates
    - Bonus points if you can animate it
    
## General Notes
- Should have the following modes/views
    - Trainer
        - Betting 
        - Basic Strategy
        - Counting
        - Quiz Game
    - Solo Game
        - Don't know if there should be
    - Group Game (2-4 People)
        - Unsure if to include other local players but this will be in a casino settings
    - NN stats (Simulaton)
        - Need to do more digging on that....
        - Should at least write a wireframe on that
    - Options
        - Don't know what it would be used for but needed. 
- Debate on having a user login once finished the Simulation on Dev TODOS
- WHEN I get to the backend. Here are some notes that I was doodling out side of dev time.
    - Inputs should be dealer and player ammount ONLY (1v1) and some how include face cards to determine splits or whatever 
    - Have the output be some binary rep of the states (Stand, Hit, Spilt, Double, or Surrender). 
    - PROBLEM is designing each node to spit out relations to get the output aka the desired state.
    - ALSO NOTE: you need to have some indicator at the top of the screen of when the needed info is completed for the NN to run simulations.
        - AKA A SHIT TON OF TESTING!!!!!! and update the UI once decided on a value.

## UI/UX Notes
- Make the cards not look like shit
- Have buttons like retro black jack
    - Look at the video poker black jack app
    - I'm not an artist and should be minimal
- See if you can find poker noises and apply them some how.
- Options should be a whole thing but just have checkbox whenever a mode is selected.

## Future updates after launch
- Selling point would be the NN stats (and other features)
    - Should be like 1-5 bucks a month for just the stats while the training thing is free.
    - Should be Free vs Premium package... just need more than a fucking NN feature.
    - Able to buy more "Fake Money" or look at charging people money some how for "Money"
